              German shepherds are large dogs known for their noble, diligent, loyal, and highly intelligent dispositions. They're characterized by a brown and black coat and a streamlined, athletic build that makes them both strong and agile. Though they are excellent herding dogs, German shepherds are also very well suited to work as service animals, such as guide dogs for the blind. They also perform well as working dogs, especially in police and military operations and make highly effective guard dogs. 

              As a breed, German shepherds have a personality that is protective, loyal and companionable. Bred with a strong work ethic, they are among the most popular dog breeds in the United States, thanks in large part to their ability to be great family dogs. They love "their people" but can be cautious around strangers or new comers and thrive on the care and attention of their family. </td>
